##APPLICATIONS of BINARY SEARCH USING C++

The BinarySearch source code included searching for a target with binary search on rotated and non-rotated arrays.
It included finding the minimum value in the rotated arrays as well. I incorporated numerous testing arrays and
output messages in the main function for testing purposes.


Execute this source code through the following commands
```
g++ -std=c++11 -o binaryS BinarySearch.cpp

```

After entering the previous command, the binaryS executable will be generated.
Then, run the following command to run the code
```
./binaryS

```
